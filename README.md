# ![](./godmode.png) **Payper**
### Recurring payments made easy.

## **Todo**

### Frontend
- [x] Sidebar
- [x] In-app notifications
- [ ] Push notifications
- [ ] Edit profile panel
- [x] Facebook auth
- [x] Facebook friend synchronization
- [x] Contact synchronization
- [ ] Invites (direct)
- [x] Invites (via payment)
- [ ] App-wide validations (Bank Onboarding, Payper Account Creation, Pay & Request)
- [ ] App-wide empty states (Tracking Page, Notifications, Payment History)
- [x] Revamp loading screen component
- [x] Bind Facebook sign out to our custom sign out button in the side menu

### Polish
- [X] CreatePaymentView.js predictive search: limit predictions to 4
- [X] CreatePaymentView.js predictive search: don't show signed in user in predictions
- [X] Pass numNotifications to menu in sidebar and render preview indicator next to notifications lightbulb
- [X] Apply fade animation to inner content during create account onboarding, not entire view
- [ ] Fix loading for IAV
- [X] Style 'Continue with Facebook' button

### Architecture
**Refactor the following to fit new Firebase/Redux model:**
- [x] Main
- [x] Payment creation
- [x] Splash page

### Bugs
- [X] Header only displays notifications on Notifications page (probably an
  issue with how numNotifications is passed to <Content />)
- [X] "Runtime is not ready for debugging" randomly appears.  **This went away when I downgraded from Node 6.2.0 to 5.5.0**
- [ ] "Severe Error, duplicates recorded in Firebase, with no auth information. To reproduce
      delete an id but not a users and Facebook id, or switch this around until you can get duplicate users through Facebook sign in or regular user sign in." https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/6682

### Brady (MVP)

- [X] Add profile page
- [X] Decrypt and append phone number and email address to user object on load
- [X] Add section headers to user ListView in UserSearch
- [X] (Vash) Modify markAsSeen endpoint to take an array of notification ID's and mark them all as seen at once

- [ ] Add global user list to UserSearch
- [ ] Add edit pages for certain properties of profile
- [ ] Add micro deposit validation to CreatePaymentFlow if user has not yet verified their bank account

### MVP Usability Bugs (Brady)

- [ ] Add back button to final page of CreatePaymentView
- [ ] Change placeholder numbers for cost and number of payments to "$0" and "0 months," respectively

- [ ] (May be fixed, come back to this if issue occurs again) Fix bug where user state is not properly reset upon signing out and signing in with another account
- [ ] (Have Vash check if he's attaching type to newly created payments) Fix bug where payment creation endpoint was not receiving a payment type (payment, request, or invite)
- [X] Fix bug where app crashes if an incoming payment is cancelled
- [X] Fix bug where Incoming/Outgoing filter state is not saved during payment creation, resulting in Outgoing payments being rendered even though the Incoming tab is selected, and vice versa
- [X] Fix bug where payment state is not reset after creating a payment
- [ ] Fix bug where sign in sometimes fails
- [ ] Fix bug where payment creation sometimes fails (talk to Vash)
- [ ] Fix bug where cancel payment endpoint is not receiving a type
- [ ] Implement token refreshing

### Dwolla Requirements

## **Note:**
Normally, after a code change to react-native-router-flux src files,
you must remove the node_modules/react-native-router-flux directory
and npm install.  The react-native packager wont follow symlinks.

To assist development, this command watches and rsyncs changes:

```
npm run sync-rnrf
```

Leave a terminal open running this command when running the Example
app and making react-native-router-flux src changes.
