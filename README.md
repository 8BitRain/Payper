### Polish
- [X] CreatePaymentView.js predictive search: limit predictions to 4
- [X] CreatePaymentView.js predictive search: don't show signed in user in predictions
- [X] Pass numNotifications to menu in sidebar and render preview indicator next to notifications lightbulb
- [X] Apply fade animation to inner content during create account onboarding, not entire view

### Architecture
**Refactor the following to fit new Firebase/Redux model:**
- [x] Main
- [x] Payment creation
- [x] Splash page

### Bugs
- [X] Header only displays notifications on Notifications page (probably an
  issue with how numNotifications is passed to <Content />)
- [X] "Runtime is not ready for debugging" randomly appears.  **This went away when I downgraded from Node 6.2.0 to 5.5.0**
- [ ] "Severe Error, duplicates recorded in Firebase, with no auth information. To reproduce delete an id but not a users and Facebook id, or switch this around until you can get duplicate users through Facebook sign in or regular user sign in." https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/6682

### MVP Usability and Design Bugs (Brady)
- [X] Adjust CreatePayment flow so that after payment creation: payment creation => outgoing tab of payments view, request creating => incoming tab of payments view
- [X] Add back button to final page of CreatePaymentView
- [X] Change placeholder numbers for cost and number of payments to 0

### MVP Logic Bugs (Brady)
- [X] Fix bug where user state is not properly reset upon signing out and signing in with another account
- [X] Fix bug where app crashes if an incoming payment is cancelled
- [X] Fix bug where Incoming/Outgoing filter state is not saved during payment creation, resulting in Outgoing payments being rendered even though the Incoming tab is selected, and vice versa
- [X] Fix bug where payment state is not reset after creating a payment
- [X] Fix bug where, upon Facebook sign in, user's session token is undefined on the add phone number screen (Eric fixed)
- [X] Fix bug where token doesn't refresh on launch, resulting in failed endpoint hits
- [X] Fix bug where the invite via payment endpoint receives incorrect sender/recip traits
- [X] Fix bug where users multiply in global user area of UserSearch (in listener, don't concatenate entire contactList with the current array, just new children)
- [X] Fix bug where you can still press create payment confirmation button while it's sending and create multiple payments
- [X] Don't render current user in UserSearch
- [X] Don't show Facebook icon for non-Facebook users in UserSearchView confirmation
- [X] Fix bug where sign in sometimes fails (tough to recreate, may be a non-issue)
- [X] Make sure payments are deleting properly (sometimes throws this.props.invite is undefined)
- [X] Listen to appFlags > numUnseenNotifications for notification indicator instead of counting them up in the front-end
- [X] Research and resolve token refresh issue
- [X] Fix duplicate user bug in global user search list
- [X] Fix bug where "Purpose" text input does not save if the user has already pressed "Pay" or "Request" and is changing something before pressing "Confirm" (just don't update payment info until user presses confirm)
- [X] Fix bug where active filter highlighting does not change accordingly after a payment is created
- [X] Fix bug where session token sign in does not work for non-Facebook users (must manually sign in each launch
- [X] Fix bug where empty notification indicator is rendered in sidebar if user has zero unseen notifications
- [X] Fix duplicate user bug in UserSearch
- [X] Don't render contacts in 'Other Payper Users' list
- [X] Fix bug where payment request rejection does not optimistically delete, also
- [X] Fix bug where payment request accept does not optimistically re-render
- [ ] Rethink handling contacts with multiple numbers (if more than one number, use the 'Mobile' number)
- [ ] Sign-in success on second attempt looks whack
- [ ] Refactor entire sign-in process (follow another React Native app's example)
- [ ] Fix bug where, when you accept or reject a payment request, your incoming tab becomes populated with the other party's incoming payments (must recreate first)

## **Versions**
* Stay at Node 5.5.0 for now! Things break on 6.2.0

## **Note:**
Normally, after a code change to react-native-router-flux src files,
you must remove the node_modules/react-native-router-flux directory
and npm install.  The react-native packager wont follow symlinks.

To assist development, this command watches and rsyncs changes:

```
npm run sync-rnrf
```

Leave a terminal open running this command when running the Example
app and making react-native-router-flux src changes.
