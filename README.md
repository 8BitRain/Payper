# ![](./godmode.png) **Payper**
### Recurring payments made easy.

## **Todo**

### Frontend
- [x] Sidebar
- [x] In-app notifications
- [ ] Push notifications
- [ ] Edit profile panel
- [x] Facebook auth
- [x] Facebook friend synchronization
- [x] Contact synchronization
- [ ] Invites (direct)
- [x] Invites (via payment)
- [ ] App-wide validations (Bank Onboarding, Payper Account Creation, Pay & Request)
- [ ] App-wide empty states (Tracking Page, Notifications, Payment History)
- [x] Revamp loading screen component
- [x] Bind Facebook sign out to our custom sign out button in the side menu

### Polish
- [X] CreatePaymentView.js predictive search: limit predictions to 4
- [X] CreatePaymentView.js predictive search: don't show signed in user in predictions
- [X] Pass numNotifications to menu in sidebar and render preview indicator next to notifications lightbulb
- [X] Apply fade animation to inner content during create account onboarding, not entire view
- [ ] Fix loading for IAV
- [X] Style 'Continue with Facebook' button

### Architecture
**Refactor the following to fit new Firebase/Redux model:**
- [x] Main
- [x] Payment creation
- [x] Splash page

### Bugs
- [X] Header only displays notifications on Notifications page (probably an
  issue with how numNotifications is passed to <Content />)
- [X] "Runtime is not ready for debugging" randomly appears.  **This went away when I downgraded from Node 6.2.0 to 5.5.0**
- [ ] "Severe Error, duplicates recorded in Firebase, with no auth information. To reproduce
      delete an id but not a users and Facebook id, or switch this around until you can get duplicate users through Facebook sign in or regular user sign in." https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/6682
- [ ] `@Eric` Sign in with Facebook throws `Cannot read property dispatchSetProvider of undefined` (LandingScreenView.js ln 164)

### Brady (MVP)
- [ ] `*Important*` Go over each case for paying and requesting (incoming payments go to outgoing sometimes, etc.)
- [X] Style payment invites
- [ ] Add global user list to UserSearch
- [X] Add confirmation message to cancel payment button
- [X] Add instant re-render for 'Cancel Payment' action
- [X] Add instant re-render for 'Accept' and 'Reject' actions
- [X] Fix bug where 'Confirm' and 'Reject' buttons aren't working properly
- [X] Fix issue where all pay and request invites are sent to "Incoming" tab (talk to Vash)
- [X] Fix opacity of header icons in CreatePaymentView
- [X] Fix issue where Payper contact list sometimes doesn't populate above phone contacts in UserSearchView (is Firebase listener receiving empty contacts and concatenating an empty array with native contacts?)
- [X] Fix header padding on small phones
- [X] Add invitee's phone number to second page of CreatePaymentView where a username would typically be rendered
- [ ] Fix bug where incoming payment appears in outgoing tab at first until you tab away (tough to recreate)
- [ ] Fix bug where user filter regex treats an exact match as a non-match ( StringMaster5000.filterContacts() )
- [X] Fix bug where payment cancellation confirmation name syntax is backwards for incoming payments
- [X] Fix bug where selecting a new page in the side menu results in rough animation (this just went away ðŸ¤”)
- [X] Fix issue where text does not wrap in the side menu
- [X] Redesign footer to be tab-less
- [ ] Add validations to CreatePayment flow
- [X] Add brute force attack protection for log in
- [X] Set up reset password email sending
- [X] Add funding sources page
- [ ] Add delete user button
- [ ] Add edit profile page
- [ ] Fix bug where on on UserSearch page of CreatePaymentView a single space is treated as a name

### Dwolla Requirements
- [X] Accept Dwolla TOS + Privacy Policy (link to Dwolla docs)
- [ ] Request permission for automatic monthly transactions
- [ ] Display funding source before payment creation (Groundwork is laid, just plug in data)
- [ ] Post initiation transfer time
- [ ] Delete account button
- [ ] FAQ
- [ ] Support
- [ ] Dispute Resolution

### Not MVP
- [ ] Implement action sheets
- [ ] Add recent users list to UserSearchView
- [ ] Add section headers to user search list view

## **Versions**

## **Note:**
Normally, after a code change to react-native-router-flux src files,
you must remove the node_modules/react-native-router-flux directory
and npm install.  The react-native packager wont follow symlinks.

To assist development, this command watches and rsyncs changes:

```
npm run sync-rnrf
```

Leave a terminal open running this command when running the Example
app and making react-native-router-flux src changes.
