ðŸ’£ When the splash page is reached, signInWithKey() is called.
    => If a key is found, user will be authenticated with Firebase and logged
       to AsyncStorage via with their:
         a) corresponding user object  (@Store:user)
         b) new session_token          (@Store:session_key)
         c) payment flow               (@Store:payment_flow)
         d) friend list                (@Store:friend_list)
       and be redirected to MainView
   => If a key is not found, user will be redirected to SignInView and, on
     submit, signInWithEmail() is called. Upon success, all the above is
     logged and the user is redirected to MainView.

ðŸ’£ Upon sign in success the app will subscribe to three listeners, each
   of which are outlined below.

   1) subscribeToUser() - listens for changes to the user object in
      Firebase and updates @Store:user in AsyncStorage

   2) subscribeToFriends() - listens for changes to the friendList object
      in Firebase and updates @Store:friend_list in AsyncStorage

   3) subscribeToPayments() - listens for changes to the paymentFlow
      object in Firebase and updates @Store:payment_flow in AsyncStorage

ðŸ’£ Here I'll outline how each of these listeners trigger re-renders of
   their respective view components.

   1) When a change is detected, we call AS.mergeItem('old', 'new');

   2) Upon success, a callback is triggered in the corresponding State.js
      script. (for example, when a payment is added, the callback in
      MainViewContainer.js is triggered)

   3) This callback fetches the new payment list from AsyncStorage and
      updates the state, triggering a re-render in the view.

## Note:

Normally, after a code change to react-native-router-flux src files,
you must remove the node_modules/react-native-router-flux directory
and npm install.  The react-native packager wont follow symlinks.

To assist development, this command watches and rsyncs changes:

```
npm run sync-rnrf
```

Leave a terminal open running this command when running the Example
app and making react-native-router-flux src changes.
