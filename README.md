# ![](./godmode.png) **Payper**
### Recurring payments made easy.

## Todo

### Frontend
- [x] Sidebar
- [x] In-app notifications
- [ ] Push notifications
- [ ] Edit profile panel
- [x] Facebook auth
- [ ] Facebook friend synchronization
- [ ] Contact synchronization
- [ ] Invites
- [ ] App-wide validations
- [ ] App-wide empty states
- [ ] Revamp loading screen component

### Polish
- [X] CreatePaymentView.js predictive search: limit predictions to 4
- [X] CreatePaymentView.js predictive search: don't show signed in user in predictions
- [ ] Pass numNotifications to menu in sidebar and render preview indicator next to notifications lightbulb
- [ ] Apply fade animation to inner content during animation project, not entire view
- [ ] App-wide padding (look into pixel density for screen size detection)
- [ ] Redesign footer (action button for new payment)
- [ ] Fix loading for IAV

### Bugs
- [X] Header only displays notifications on Notifications page (probably an
  issue with how numNotifications is passed to <Content />)
- [X] "Runtime is not ready for debugging" randomly appears.

## Note:
Normally, after a code change to react-native-router-flux src files,
you must remove the node_modules/react-native-router-flux directory
and npm install.  The react-native packager wont follow symlinks.

To assist development, this command watches and rsyncs changes:

```
npm run sync-rnrf
```

Leave a terminal open running this command when running the Example
app and making react-native-router-flux src changes.
