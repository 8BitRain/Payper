## **To Do**

- [ ] Bind payment card background opacities to the payment objects themselves, otherwise re-renders will re-calculate opacities and result in ugly payment removal
- [ ] Experiment with tab-switching animation
- [ ] Re-design background to better contrast foreground text
- [ ] Reconfigure timing between payment removal animation and payment data source updating
- [ ] Properly update payment card height after a payment is accepted
- [ ] Give 'More info' section of payment cards a dynamic height instead of static
